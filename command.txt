Hey. Hiii. I'm a complete beginner to Angular. I have Angular Version 18 installed on my device. Now I have created a backend APIs using ASP.NET core for a Bus ticket booking application. Now I want to convert it into a fullstack project by integrating the frontend using Angular 18. I'm a complete beginner can you guide me to complete this project. Don't give the code first. First we have to discuss everything before completing a module so that we can catch errors earlier and make our app works smooth. We have to create a RedBus app like application. But let's use Orange-white theme application. Do you suggest any colors to be added in the theme to make our app UI better. Our app should have a great UI because it's the face of our app. I will provide you the database schema for the project. Have a look on this and analyse and tell can we proceed with frontend or we have to make any changes to the database schema. And my current backend code will only show the available tickets on a bus in a trip and make him to book. But we have to create a real world app like where we have to select seat in the UI and book. The UI has to show the available seats as well the booked tickets to differentiate. I want our application to look perfect with the existing backend code. If we want any modifications in APIs or have to create a new API for a functionality let' s create them on the flow. Let's go one by one. Ask for any backend code before proceeding with your angular code. Don't assume and give the code. Have clarifications cleared and get confirmation before proceeding. I want this application with most of the functionalities as RedBus and it has to be like a real world application. Though I'm a beginner learning web development, I have to create a real world application by completing this project. We have to add icons, bus images wherever possible to make the UI look better. Okay, Now let me give you the database schema and note that here we use only soft delete where we set the column named 'IsDeleted' to true.
